You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. 
But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue

1. Make sure you’re connecting to the service’s cluster IP from within the cluster, not from the outside.

2. If you’ve defined a readiness probe, make sure it’s succeeding; otherwise the pod won’t be part of the service.

3. To confirm that a pod is part of the service, examine the corresponding Endpoints object with kubectl get endpoints.

4. Check whether you’re connecting to the port exposed by the service and not the target port.

5. Try connecting to the pod IP directly to confirm your pod is accepting connections on the correct port.
